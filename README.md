Simple LFS Scripts for the Raspberry Pi
=======================================

This project is a fork of the orignal detLFS-project from
[http://www.dettus.net/detLFS/](http://www.dettus.net/detLFS/). You should fetch
the "Getting-Started"-guide from there.

The `detLFS`-directory contains my modified versions of the original files. The file
`bsd_twoclause.txt` has been moved as file `LICENSE` to the top-level directory.


Modifications
-------------

coming soon!
